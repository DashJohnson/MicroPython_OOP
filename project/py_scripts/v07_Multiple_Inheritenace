"""
Multiple Inheritance is used to inherit the properties of 
multiple classes. However, because both these classes inherit
from the built-in 'machine' library  they will conflict and
you will get errors. You will find this is the case for all
the classes in MicroPython that control the Pi Pico.

This code snippet is just to demonstrate the concept and 
syntax of multiple inheritance.
